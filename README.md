# DeArtisanMarket
This repository houses the development of a comprehensive and safety-conscious artisan booking application. This application helps to seamlessly connect service users with local artisans, ensuring a smooth and reliable experience for both parties involved.
In today's fast-paced society, individuals often encounter difficulties in locating skilled artisans for their diverse needs, whether it's repairing a leaky faucet, constructing custom furniture, or tackling electrical issues. Traditional methods of finding artisans, such as word-of-mouth recommendations or online searches, often result in time-consuming and frustrating experiences due to a lack of reliable information and accessibility.
"DeArtisanmarket" is a specialized app designed to serve the needs of individuals seeking skilled artisans. The platform caters to a broad spectrum of professionals including carpenters, plumbers, and more. The app's dual functionality allows users to either find an artisan for specific tasks or, if they are artisans themselves, to list their services. This not only simplifies the process of hiring skilled workers but also provides an opportunity for artisans to showcase their skills and expand their clientele.
